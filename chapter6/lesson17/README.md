# Lesson 17: Introduction to Multi-Agent Systems with AutoGen

This lesson introduces the fundamentals of building multi-agent systems using the AutoGen framework. You will learn how to orchestrate multiple AI agents to collaborate on complex tasks, leveraging their specialized capabilities to achieve a common goal.

## Key Learning Objectives

- **Multi-Agent Concepts**: Understand the core principles of multi-agent systems, including collaboration, communication, and role-based specialization.
- **AutoGen Framework**: Learn the key components of AutoGen, such as `ConversableAgent` and `UserProxyAgent`.
- **Agent Orchestration**: See how to define a group of agents and orchestrate their interaction to solve a problem.
- **Practical Applications**: Explore common use cases for multi-agent systems, such as automated problem-solving, code generation, and content creation.

## File Descriptions

*This lesson currently contains placeholder files. The example scripts demonstrating specific AutoGen implementations are not yet available.*

- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the lesson.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the necessary Python dependencies for this lesson.

## Setup and Execution

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Install the required packages using pip.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Run the Examples**:
    *(Once example files are added to this directory, you will be able to run them to see the multi-agent system in action.)*

    For example:
    ```bash
    # This is a hypothetical command
    python run_autogen_example.py
    ```
