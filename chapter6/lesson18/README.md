# Lesson 18: Building Multimodal Knowledge Graphs

This lesson explores the advanced topic of building multimodal knowledge graphs, which integrate information from different data types, such as text and images. You will learn how to extract, fuse, and represent knowledge from diverse sources in a unified graph structure.

## Key Learning Objectives

- **Multimodal Knowledge Graphs**: Understand what multimodal knowledge graphs are and why they are important for a comprehensive understanding of complex domains.
- **Multimodal Information Extraction**: Learn techniques for extracting entities, relations, and attributes from both text and images.
- **Knowledge Fusion**: Explore methods for fusing information from different modalities into a single, coherent knowledge graph.
- **Advanced Applications**: Discover the potential applications of multimodal knowledge graphs, such as cross-modal question answering and intelligent document analysis.

## File Descriptions

*This lesson currently contains placeholder files. The example scripts demonstrating the construction of a multimodal knowledge graph are not yet available.*

- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the lesson.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the necessary Python dependencies for this lesson.

## Setup and Execution

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Install the required packages using pip.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Run the Examples**:
    *(Once example files are added to this directory, you will be able to run them to see the multimodal knowledge graph construction in action.)*

    For example:
    ```bash
    # This is a hypothetical command
    python run_multimodal_kg_example.py
    ```
