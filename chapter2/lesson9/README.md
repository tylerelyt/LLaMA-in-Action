# Lesson 9: Implementing a ReAct Agent

This lesson provides a deep dive into the ReAct (Reason, Act) framework, a powerful paradigm for building agents that can reason about a problem, use tools to gather information, and formulate a final answer. You will learn how to implement a ReAct agent from scratch.

## Key Learning Objectives

- **ReAct Framework**: Understand the core "Thought -> Action -> Observation" loop that powers ReAct agents.
- **Tool Creation and Registration**: Learn how to create a registry for custom tools that the agent can use.
- **Dynamic Prompting**: See how to construct a detailed system prompt that instructs the LLM on how to behave as a ReAct agent, including the available tools and the expected output format.
- **Agent Loop**: Implement the main control loop that parses the LLM's output, executes actions, and feeds observations back into the context.

## File Descriptions

- `example1.py`: A complete, from-scratch implementation of a ReAct agent. The agent is tasked with solving a problem that requires both looking up scientific constants and performing calculations. The code clearly demonstrates the tool registry, dynamic prompt generation, and the main reasoning loop.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the necessary Python dependencies for this lesson.

## Setup and Execution

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Install the required packages using pip.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Run the Example**:
    Execute the script to see the ReAct agent solve the problem step-by-step.
    ```bash
    python example1.py
    ```
    The script will output the agent's internal monologue (Thought), the actions it takes, the observations it makes from the tools, and the final answer.
