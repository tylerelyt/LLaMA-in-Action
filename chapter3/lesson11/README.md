```

#### Step 1: Candidate Extraction
```python
# Use structured prompts to extract entities, relations, and attributes
entities, relations = extractor.extract_candidates(text)
```
- 🎯 **Objective**: Identify all potential knowledge elements in text
- 🔧 **Technology**: Few-shot based structured extraction
- 📊 **Output**: Candidate entity list and relation triples

#### Step 2: Schema Optimization  
```python
# Normalize entity types, relation types, and attribute types
optimized_schema = extractor.optimize_ontology(entities, relations)
```
- 🎯 **Objective**: Unify and standardize knowledge graph schema
- 🔧 **Technology**: Type merging and semantic clustering
- 📊 **Output**: Standardized type definitions

#### Step 3: Refinement & Relabeling
```python
# Relabel candidate triples according to optimized schema
refined_triples = extractor.refine_and_relabel(triples, schema)
```
- 🎯 **Objective**: Map candidate relations to standard schema
- 🔧 **Technology**: Semantic matching and type mapping
- 📊 **Output**: Schema-compliant refined triples

#### Step 4: Role Analysis with Chain-of-Thought
```python
# Use Chain-of-Thought analysis to determine entity counts
role_analysis = extractor.analyze_roles(text)
```
- 🎯 **Objective**: Identify true number of independent entities in text
- 🔧 **Technology**: **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**
- 📊 **Output**: Entity count for each role type

#### Step 5: Context-Aware Entity Linking
```python
# Perform intelligent entity merging based on role analysis results
alias_map = extractor.link_entities(entities, role_analysis)
```
- 🎯 **Objective**: Merge different expressions referring to same entity
- 🔧 **Technology**: Context-aware alias recognition
- 📊 **Output**: Entity alias mapping table

### 2. Chain-of-Thought Advantages

#### Traditional Approach vs CoT Method
```python
# Traditional approach: Direct extraction
entities = ["Apple Inc.", "CEO", "Tim Cook", "Mr. Cook"]

# CoT approach: Step-by-step reasoning
reasoning = """
1. Identify role types: Company(1), Person(1)
2. Analyze coreference relations:
   - "Tim Cook" = Proper name, core identifier  
   - "Mr. Cook" = Respectful reference to same person
   - "CEO" = Position description, not independent entity
3. Conclusion: Should merge into one person entity
"""
final_entities = ["Apple Inc.", "Tim Cook"]  # Significantly improved accuracy
```

### 3. Knowledge Graph Quality Assessment

#### Automated Quality Metrics
```python
quality = kg.assess_quality()
# Example output:
{
    "node_count": 4,
    "edge_count": 3, 
    "density": 0.75,
    "avg_degree": 1.5,
    "connected_components": 1
}
```

## 📊 Practical Case Study

### Sample Input Text
```
Apple Inc.'s CEO Tim Cook announced the new iPhone 15 product yesterday at the California headquarters.
This revolutionary smartphone features the advanced A17 chip with excellent performance and outstanding camera capabilities.
Mr. Cook was very satisfied with this launch event, stating it's one of the most important products in Apple's history.
```

### Extraction Results
```python
# Final knowledge graph
entities = [
    {"name": "Tim Cook", "type": "Person", "attributes": {"position": "CEO", "emotion": "satisfied"}},
    {"name": "Apple Inc.", "type": "Organization", "attributes": {"headquarters": "California"}},
    {"name": "iPhone 15", "type": "Product", "attributes": {"chip": "A17", "feature": "revolutionary"}}
]

relations = [
    {"subject": "Tim Cook", "predicate": "serves_as_CEO", "object": "Apple Inc."},
    {"subject": "Apple Inc.", "predicate": "released", "object": "iPhone 15"},
    {"subject": "Tim Cook", "predicate": "announced", "object": "iPhone 15"}
]
```

### Visualization Features
- 🎨 **Interactive Nodes**: Drag, zoom, hover for details
- 🏷️ **Relation Labels**: Clear edge labels showing relation types  
- 🎯 **Attribute Display**: Hover to show entity attribute information
- 📐 **Auto Layout**: Physics-based attractive arrangement

## 🔍 Key Learning Points & Technical Focus

### 1. Understanding Entity-Relation-Attribute Separation
```python
# ✅ Correct classification
Entity: "John Smith"      # Independent object
Relation: "works_at"      # Action/connection between entities  
Attribute: "experienced"  # Characteristic/property of entity

# ❌ Common mistakes
Entity: "experienced John Smith"  # Should split into Entity + Attribute
Relation: "John is diligent"      # "diligent" is attribute not relation
```

### 2. Mastering Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Pattern
```python
# CoT reasoning template
"""
1. [Text Understanding]: Identify text theme and scenario
2. [Role Identification]: Determine involved role types
3. [Instance Analysis]: Analyze specific instances under each role type
4. [Identity Judgment]: Identify different expressions referring to same object
5. [Count Conclusion]: Determine number of independent entities for each role
"""
```

### 3. Core Entity Linking Strategies
- **Proper Name Priority**: Names, locations etc. as primary identifiers
- **Contextual Consistency**: Analyze semantic relevance
- **Modifier Handling**: Adjectives typically don't create new entities
- **Count Constraints**: Based on CoT analysis quantity limits

## 🛠️ Customization & Extension

### 1. Replace Input Text
```python
# Modify sample_text.txt or replace in code
text_content = "Your domain-specific text..."
```

### 2. Custom Entity Types
```python
# Specify domain-specific types during Schema optimization
domain_entities = ["Person", "Organization", "Technology", "Event"]
domain_relations = ["develops", "participates_in", "located_at"]
```

### 3. Adjust Model Parameters
```python
# Choose different LLM models
LLM_MODEL = "gpt-4"  # or "qwen-plus", "gpt-3.5-turbo"

# Adjust reasoning temperature
temperature = 0.1    # More conservative output
```
