# Lesson 2: Advanced LLM Applications

This lesson explores advanced applications of Large Language Models, focusing on agent-based systems, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and chain-of-thought prompting. You will learn how to build sophisticated applications that leverage external tools, document retrieval, and complex reasoning.

## Key Learning Objectives

- **Agent Creation**: Learn to create agents with custom tools using LangChain.
- **Code Translation**: Use an LLM for programmatic code translation between languages.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Build a RAG pipeline to answer questions from a knowledge base.
- **Chain of Thought**: Implement sequential chains for complex, multi-step problem-solving.
- **Document Analysis**: Apply an LLM to analyze and answer questions about a legal document.

## File Descriptions

- `example1.py`: Demonstrates how to build a LangChain agent with a custom tool for mathematical calculations.
- `example2.py`: Shows how to use Ollama for code translation from Python to JavaScript.
- `example3.py`: Implements a RAG system using ChromaDB for vector storage and `bge-m3` for embeddings.
- `example4.py`: Illustrates a sequential chain-of-thought process for structured problem-solving.
- `example5.py`: Provides an example of document analysis on a legal text.
- `data/legal_document.txt`: A sample legal document used in `example5.py`.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the necessary Python dependencies for this lesson.

## Setup and Execution

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Install the required packages using pip.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Run the Examples**:
    Execute the individual scripts to explore the different functionalities.
    ```bash
    # For the custom tool agent
    python example1.py

    # For the RAG system
    python example3.py

    # For the document analysis
    python example5.py
    ```
