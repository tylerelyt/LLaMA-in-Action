# Lesson 4: Advanced Reasoning with LLMs

This lesson delves into advanced reasoning techniques that go beyond simple prompting. You will learn how to guide a Large Language Model through complex problem-solving by structuring its thought process.

## Key Learning Objectives

- **Chain of Thought (CoT)**: Understand and implement basic CoT prompting to encourage step-by-step thinking.
- **Multi-Turn Reasoning**: Learn how to build context over multiple interactions to solve a larger problem.
- **Task Decomposition**: Break down a complex task into smaller, manageable sub-tasks for the LLM to process.
- **Reasoning with Checkpoints**: Implement a workflow where the LLM's output is validated at each step before proceeding, ensuring a more reliable final outcome.

## File Descriptions

- `example1.py`: Demonstrates a basic "Let's think step by step" Chain of Thought prompt.
- `example2.py`: Shows how to conduct a multi-turn reasoning process, accumulating information across several steps.
- `example3.py`: Implements task decomposition, assigning different roles to handle various parts of a complex problem.
- `example4.py`: Illustrates a sophisticated reasoning pipeline with checkpoints, where each step's output is validated before being included in the final result.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the necessary Python dependencies for this lesson.

## Setup and Execution

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Install the required packages using pip.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Run the Examples**:
    Execute the individual scripts to see each reasoning technique in action.
    ```bash
    # Basic Chain of Thought
    python example1.py

    # Task Decomposition
    python example3.py

    # Reasoning with Checkpoints
    python example4.py
    ```
