# Lesson 3: Building a Tool-Using Agent

This lesson demonstrates how to build a practical, tool-using agent with an open-source LLM. You will learn to create an agent that can interact with external APIs to retrieve real-time information and answer user queries.

## Key Learning Objectives

- **Tool Creation**: Learn how to define custom tools that call external APIs.
- **Agent Initialization**: Understand how to initialize a LangChain agent and equip it with custom tools.
- **Multi-Step Reasoning**: See how an agent can perform a sequence of actions (e.g., fetch a city code, then fetch the weather) to fulfill a request.
- **API Integration**: Gain experience integrating a third-party API (AMAP Weather API) into your application.

## File Descriptions

- `multimodal_chat.py`: Implements an agent that can retrieve real-time weather information. The agent first fetches a city's administrative code and then uses that code to query a weather API. **Note**: The filename is a misnomer; this lesson focuses on tool use, not multimodal chat.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the necessary Python dependencies for this lesson.

## Setup and Execution

1.  **Get an API Key**:
    This lesson uses the AMAP Weather API. You will need to get a free API key from the [AMAP Open Platform](https://lbs.amap.com/).

2.  **Configure the API Key**:
    Open `multimodal_chat.py` and replace `'YOUR KEY'` with your actual AMAP API key.
    ```python
    # multimodal_chat.py
    AMAP_KEY = 'YOUR KEY'  # Replace with your AMAP application key
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Install the required packages using pip.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the Example**:
    Execute the script to see the agent in action.
    ```bash
    python multimodal_chat.py
    ```
    The agent will process the user's question ("What's the weather in Beijing?"), call the necessary tools, and print the result.
